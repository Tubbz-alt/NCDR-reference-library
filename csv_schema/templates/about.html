                The Data Services for Commissioners Reference Library Portal provides a central point for all
                definitions of data items held on the National Commissioning Data Repository (NCDR). The NCDR is
                the pseudonymised patient-level data repository managed by NHS England to deliver consistent data
                processing, linkage and reporting services, mainly for NHS England analytical teams, to aid in the
                delivery of the Five Year Forward View.
                All content is governed by internal review processes with further assurance received from subject
                matter experts throughout the wider NHS and other healthcare organisations. We make sure that
                each definition is signed off by an expert in the area before publication to ensure this resource can
                be trusted by all.

              <h3 id="about_us">About us</h3>
              <p>
                The Reference Library Portal is owned and managed by the Data Service for Commissioners (DSfC)
                team. The vision of the DSfC team is to enable commissioners to consistently access the data they
                need in a lawful, consistent and efficient manner.
              </p>
              <p>
                The work of Data Services for Commissioners will have broad reaching benefits for all analytical
                functions across NHS England and the wider commissioning landscape. The NCDR employs
                consistent data quality processes and, where sufficient legal basis exists, enables access to and
                linkage of pseudonymised patient-level data. This upholds the requirements of patient
                confidentiality, as determined by the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), while enabling the
                use of sufficiently granular data to support commissioning and population health management.
                Data Services for Commissioners is focussed on increasing information and digital capability to
                provide the data that commissioners require for effective decision making, improving service quality,
                ensuring safety, encouraging informatics colleagues to add value (rather than work on routine tasks)
                and promoting effectiveness and efficiency. These improvements will save time and resource for
                colleagues within the wider NHS, allowing them to focus their expertise on improving outcomes for
                patients.
              </p>
              <p>
                The NCDR also plays a key role in delivering Five Year Forward View objectives. By developing
                datasets that are based on standard, consistent definitions across differing healthcare settings, NHS
                England will be better equipped to consistently track cohorts of people through their journey around
                the NHS; an essential factor in moving towards preventative and early intervention care, and
                population health management.
              </p>
              <p>
                DSfC is committed to improving access to services by developing reusable routine reporting and
                analysis methods, which can be adopted throughout the whole commissioning system to support
                strategic programmes of work. By reducing the amount of time analysts spend processing data, time
                can be spent more appropriately, increasing analytical capacity and access to reporting tools which
                will provide improved business intelligence services to local, regional and national users.
                Through developing one, central, data repository to store and transform linked datasets, the NCDR
                provides a single source of the truth for data which can be accessed and analysed by colleagues
                across the country, boosting connectivity and collaboration.

              <h4>NCDR Data Definition</h4>
              <p>
                This section contains definitions of data items in specific databases and tables within the NCDR. It
                allows the user to find detailed information relating to all data items within the NCDR. The chosen
                database and table names correspond directly with the setup within the databases.
                With this knowledge, analysts can be assured that the data items they use in their analyses are
                correct, both in how they are derived by the NCDR team and used by analysts. By increasing the
                understanding of the data, the quality, scope and efficiency of analyses will be enhanced across the
                country.
              </p>
              <h4>Reference Data</h4>
              <p>
                In development; if you are interested in working with us in developing the content for this section,
                please contact us.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Reference Data section will provide details on all data items within the NCDR, irrespective of
                which table these data items are stored in. It will also contain any codes and values that may form
                part of the reference data item.
              </p>
              <h4>Mapping</h4>
              <p>
                In development; if you are interested in working with us in developing the content for this section,
                please contact us.
              <p>
              <p>
                The mapping section will enable the mapping of data items with the same meaning and use, but
                perhaps different names, along with the codes within them, if applicable. As an example, if there is
                a field named ‘Sex’ in one dataset, and a field named ‘Gender’ in another, they could be mapped to
                each other, and if within the ‘Sex’ field, the code of ‘1’ means male, and within the ‘Gender’ field ‘M’
                means male, the ‘1’ and ‘M’ could also be mapped. When this is complete analyses across similar
                fields in different datasets will be streamlined, further improving our view of the patients’ journey.
              </p>
              <h4>Group</h4>
              <p>
                In development; if you are interested in working with us in developing the content for this section,
                please contact us.
              </p>
              <p>
                The group section will provide details of any groups that have been set up to help the user
                community enhance their analytical capability. For example, a group could be set up that provides
                detailed information to enable identification of patients with long term conditions, or groups that
                are disease specific, for example, cancer patients. Groups will be set up according to user needs and
                priorities. Please contact us if you have specific requirements that you wish to discuss.
