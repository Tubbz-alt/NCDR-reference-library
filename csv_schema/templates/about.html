            The National Commissioning Data Repository (NCDR) Reference Library
            holds definitions of all data elements held on the NCDR. The NCDR is
            the pseudonymised patient-level data repository managed by the
            NHS England team Data Services for Commissioners. It is designed
            to deliver consistent data processing, linkage and reporting
            services, mainly for the use of NHS England analytical teams in
            order to aid in the delivery of a wide range of projects,
            including the Five Year Forward View.

          <h3 class="subheader">Who are Data Services for Commissioners?</h3>
          <p>
            The NCDR Reference Library is owned and managed by the Data
            Services for Commissioners (DSfC) team. The vision of the DSfC
            team is to enable commissioners to consistently access the data
            they need in a lawful, consistent and efficient manner.
          </p>
          <p>
            We enable analysts to access pseudonymised patient-level data to
            support commissioning and population health management while
            upholding the requirements of patient confidentiality, as
            determined by the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO). Our
            focus is on increasing information and digital capability to
            provide the data that commissioners require for effective decision
            making, improving service quality and ensuring safety. We also hope
            to encourage informatics colleagues to add value to promote their
            effectiveness and efficiency.
          </p>
          <p>
            The NCDR plays a key role in delivering Five Year Forward View
            objectives. By developing datasets that are based on standard,
            consistent definitions across differing healthcare settings, NHS
            England will be better equipped to track people through their
            journey around the NHS.
          </p>
          <p>
            DSfC is committed to improving access to services by developing
            reusable routine reporting and analysis methods, which can be
            adopted throughout the whole commissioning system to support
            strategic programmes of work and boost connectivity and
            collaboration.
          </p>

          <h3 class="subheader">What is on the Reference Library?</h3>

          <h4 class="subheader">Databases</h4>
          <p>
            This contains definitions of all databases and tables within the
            NCDR, along with detailed descriptions of all data elements. This has
            been done so analysts can be assured that the data elements they use
            in their analyses are correct, both in how they are derived by the
            NCDR team and how they are used by the analysts themselves.
          </p>
          <p>
            Useful if you need to understand the specific contents of a table
            or database.
          </p>

          <h4 class="subheader">Data Elements</h4>
          <p>
            This is one list of all unique data elements found in the NCDR, and
            from there says which databases and tables they can be found in.
            This allows analysts to transfer their knowledge of certain
            datasets to others when the need arises.
          </p>
          <p>
            Useful if you are looking for a specific data element and don’t know
            where to find it.
