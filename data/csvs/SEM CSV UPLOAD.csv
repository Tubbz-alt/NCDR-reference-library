(i.e. not a follow up) which has received a procedure tariff and has a completed Treatment_Function_Code of anything other than ?329? then ?OPPROCFA? is used, in the same circumstances but Der_Appointment_Type is ?Fop? it is ?OPPROCFUP?, and if Der_Appointment_Type is not ?New? or ?FUp? then it is ?OPPROC?.
If Der_Contact_Type is ?NF2F? and Der_Appointment_Type is ?New? then ?NF2FFA? is used, when Der_Appointment_Type is ?FUp? then ?NF2FFUP? and when Der_Appointment_Type is neither of these, then ?NF2F? is used.
Next, combinations of Der_Staff_Type (?Cons? or ?Non-cons?), Der_Professional_Type (?Single? or ?Multi?) and Der_Appointment_Type (?New?, ?FUp?)are looked at.  
When the record is ?Cons?, ?Single? and ?New? then ?OPFASPCL? is used, 
when ?Non-cons?, ?Single? and ?New? then ?OPFASPNCL?, 
when ?Cons?, ?Multi? and ?New? then ?OPFAMPCL?, 
when ?Non-cons?, ?Multi? and ?New? then ?OPFAMPNCL?, 
when ?Cons?, ?Single? and ?FUp? then ?OPFUPSPCL?, 
when ?Non-cons?, ?Single? and ?FUp? then ?OPFUPSPNCL?, 
when ?Cons?, ?Multi? and ?FUp? then ?OPFUPMPCL?, 
when ?Non-cons?, ?Multi? and ?FUp? then ?OPFUPMPNCL? is used.
If none of these combinations apply, ?OPFA? is applied when Der_Appoinment_Type is ?New?, and ?OPFUP? if it is ?FUp?.  Finally, any remaining records are classed as ?OPAUNK?.",Rob Kennedy,31/08/2017,,
