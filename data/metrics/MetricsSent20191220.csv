The four-hour access standard is an intuitive, pragmatic and simple process measure that holds acute trust boards to account to improve emergency care. It provides powerful incentives for NHS managers to improve patient care in emergency departments. Recently, it has become apparent that the standard is a useful indicator of how the whole urgent care system – from NHS 111 call, primary care contact, ambulance response, emergency admission and discharge to social care – performs.¬Number of A&E attendances from arrival to admission, transfer or discharge within 4 hours¬Total A&E attendances¬The following fields from A&E attendances and emergency admissions monthly return (MSitAE via SDCS) are required to construct the numerator and denominator: Number of A&E attendances (all types of A&E); Number of A&E attendances within 4 hours from arrival to admission, transfer or discharge (all types of A&E).¬A&E attendances and emergency admissions monthly return¬"https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/ae-waiting-times-and-activity/

Operational standard is 0."¬To improve patient safety, experience and patient outcomes¬Number of patients not treated within 28 days of last minute elective cancellation¬N/A¬"A breach should be counted at the point it occurs i.e. if after 28 days of a last minute cancellation the patient has not been treated then the breach should be recorded. The last minute cancellation associated with this breach may have occurred in the same quarter or in a previous quarter. Please note that the 28 day period does not stop at the end of a quarter but is continuous.

The following should also be noted:
* All planned or elective operations should be counted including day cases. (Patient classification = 1 or 2, Admission method = 11, 12 or 13). As a general guide, include all patients where an OPCS-4 operation code procedure was to be carried out. Do not include minor outpatient procedures.
* Invasive X-ray procedures carried out on inpatients or day cases should be counted, as an operation and any cancelled procedures should be included for the purpose of monitoring this standard.
* Telephone cancellations made to patients on or after the day of admission should be included for the purpose of monitoring this standard

An operation which is rescheduled to a time within 24 hours of the original scheduled operation should be recorded as a postponement and not as a cancellation."¬Strategic Data Collection Service (SDCS)¬"https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/cancelled-elective-operations/

Operational standard is 0."¬Patients who have experienced MSA say they felt this compromised their privacy and a dignity at a time when they already felt vulnerable and this was a concern for them. Monitoring breaches of the guidance means that organisations will be held to account for managing beds and facilities to eliminate occurrences of MSA. It also better facilitates commissioners’ application of sanctions to NHS organisations that breach the guidance. Publication of the associated breach data means that patients and the public will be better informed about an organisation’s progress in eliminating MSA.¬Number of MSA breaches for the reporting month¬N/A¬"As well as monitoring and reporting all unjustified mixing of sleeping accommodation, NHS Trusts are also required to monitor all justified mixing in sleeping accommodation, all mixed-sex sharing of bathroom / toilet facilities (including passing through accommodation or toilet / bathroom facilities used by the opposite gender), and all mixed provision of day space in mental health units at a local level. For practical reasons, central reporting has been mandated for MSA breaches in respect of sleeping accommodation only.

“Sleeping accommodation” includes areas where patients are admitted and cared for on beds or trolleys, even where they do not stay overnight.

There is no operational standard"¬The Government set a national ambition to eliminate inappropriate OAPs in mental health services for adults in acute inpatient care by 2020-21. Inappropriate OAPs are where patients are sent out of area because no bed is available for them locally, which can delay their recovery. It is essential to collect OAPs data in order to monitor progress towards achieving the ambition and to understand where and why OAPs are happening. Having this information is critical to improving patient care and ultimately eliminating the practice of inappropriately sending patients out of area to receive acute inpatient care.¬The number of bed days due to inappropriate out of area bed days for adult non specialist acute mental health care.¬N/A¬"An OAP is when a patient with assessed acute mental health needs who requires non-specialised inpatient care (CCG commissioned), is admitted to a unit that does not form part of the usual local network of services. This includes inpatient units that:
1. are not run by the patient’s home mental health care provider, regardless of distance travelled or whether the admitting unit is run by an NHS or Independent Sector Provider (ISP);
2. are not intended to admit people living in the catchment of the person’s local community mental health team (CMHT);
3. are located in a place where the person cannot be visited regularly by their care coordinator to ensure continuity of care and effective discharge planning.

The stated objectives were to improve the experience and outcomes for wheelchair users by supporting the implementation of the action plan from the national Wheelchair Summit; piloting the wheelchair tariff and supporting improved commissioning. This indicator places an emphasis on timely delivery of equipment and provision of service to children and young adults below the age of 18 years old. Not receiving equipment in a timely manner severely limits independence, mobility and quality of life of affected individuals.¬Number of children whose episode of care was closed within the reporting period where equipment was delivered in 18 weeks or less of being referred to the service¬Total number of children whose episode of care was closed within the reporting period (quarter) where equipment was delivered or a modification was made¬All data collected for this indicator relates to episodes of care which have been completed (equipment handed over to patient) within the reporting period, the care pathway may have been initiated before the reporting period. i.e. the prescription decision may have been made in a previous quarter, but the episode of care will still be counted as part of this question if the prescription was fulfilled during the reporting period. The clock starts with the date that the patient was referred to the service, not the data that the prescription decision was made. The clock stops where the patient pathway is complete, i.e. equipment, accessories or modification received by patient. The reporting period consists of the three months that make up the year quarter. This indicator specifically focuses on children; a patient is considered to be a child up to their 18th birthday.¬National Wheelchair Data Collection via Strategic Data Collection Service (SDCS)¬"https://www.england.nhs.uk/wheelchair-services/nhse-role/#data
