A range is offered: the lower figure is based on the average for all of the closest 10 CCGs; the upper figure is based on the average for the five of the closest 10 CCGs with the lowest rates.

Distance of closest 10 CCGs (excluding specialised commissioning) is defined as the sum of squared differences between 12 standardised demographic variables. The standardisation method is interdecile standardisation, which is calculated by taking the CCG value, subtracting the medium, and then dividing by the difference between the 90th and 10th percentiles.

Distance of closest 10 CCGs (excluding specialised commissioning) is defined as the sum of squared differences between 12 standardised demographic variables.

A data period of 12 months is used to produce an annual output.  Data are shown for all persons, directly standardised by age and sex.

Directly age and sex standardised admission rate for unplanned hospitalisation for chronic ambulatory care sensitive conditions per 100,000 registered patients, 95% confidence intervals (CI).

The admissions rate for each LSOA-CCG is constructed using the CCG of registration and LSOA of residence.

The indirectly age and sex-standardised rate of unplanned hospitalisation per 100,000 registered population is calculated for every LSOA of residence, because these are legitimate drivers in the variation in avoidable emergency admissions. Indirect standardisation must be used as there are many LSOAs that do not have populations in all age-sex groups.

The AGI is calculated for each CCG by weighted least squares using the indirectly age-standardised rate of unplanned hospitalisation per 100,000 registered population as the dependent variable; the rank of IMD 2015 (on a scale of 0 to 1) as the independent variable, and the CCGs population in each LSOA as the weight. The coefficient on the rank of IMD is the slope and is called the AGI.

As the IMD is on a scale of 0 to 1, the slope gives the expected difference in the rate of unplanned hospitalisation in the most deprived compared to the least deprived LSOA in England if they were in that CCG."¬Inequalities persist and these should be reduced for the benefit of patients and for CCGs to meet legal duties.

267¬Appropriate prescribing of antibiotics in primary care¬Proportion of appropriate prescribing of antibiotics in primary care by CCG¬"The number of antibiotics prescribed in primary care divided by the Item based Specific Therapeutic group AgeSex related Prescribing Unit STAR-PU.

For data at CCG level, prescriptions written by a prescriber located in a particular CCG but dispensed outside that CCG will be included in the CCG in which the prescriber is based. Prescriptions written in England but dispensed outside England are included. Prescriptions dispensed in hospitals, dental prescribing and private prescriptions are not included in the data. The data is to include prescribing by Out of Hours and Urgent Care services where relevant prescribing data is captured within NHS BSA ePACT2.

The numerator represents actual population figures and do not need to be standardised. When used in conjunction with Specific Therapeutic Group Age-sex weightings Related Prescribing Units (STAR-PUs) data is comparable across Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs).

There are differences in the age and sex of patients for whom drugs in specific therapeutic groups are usually prescribed. STAR-PUs (Specific Therapeutic Group Age-sex weightings Related Prescribing Units) allow more accurate and meaningful comparisons within a specific therapeutic group by taking into account the types of people who will be receiving that treatment. This weighting is designed to weight individual practice or organisation populations for age and sex to allow for better comparison of prescribing patterns. The total number of Oral antibacterials (BNF 5.1 sub-set) ITEM based STAR-PUs are used as the denominator of this indicator.

STAR-PU weightings have been updated to reflect current prescribing practice, based on prescribing patterns in primary care in England in 2013. These were made available and introduced into national prescribing data sets in February 2014."¬The purpose of this indicator is to encourage an improvement in appropriate antibiotic prescribing in primary care. Antimicrobial resistant infections impact on patient safety and the quality of patient care. Evidence suggests that antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is driven by over-using antibiotics and prescribing them inappropriately. Reducing the inappropriate use of antibiotics will delay the development of antimicrobial resistance that leads to patient harm from infections that are harder and more costly to treat. Reducing inappropriate antibiotic use will also protect patients from healthcare acquired infections such as Clostridium difficile infections.¬Total number of prescription items for antibacterial drugs (BNF 5.1) within the CCG in the previous 12 months.¬Total number of Oral antibacterials (BNF 5.1 sub-set) ITEM based Specific Therapeutic group Age-Sex Related Prescribing Units (STAR-PUs) for the previous 12 months.¬"From the Antibiotic quality premium monitoring dashboard Antibiotics STAR PU 13 tab, most recent month for Indicator (ITEMS/STAR-PU)

Hospital sector comprises Acute, Mental Health and Community and is based on the ratings awarded to the core services rated for each of CQC's five key questions. For Acute and Mental Health hospitals the ratings are sourced at provider level to maximise coverage across the CCG areas and to be consistent across both hospital areas.

The numerator for hospitals includes all rated services, which usually covers what CQC call core services. The hospitals metric uses patient datasets to weight the numerator for Acute and Mental Health Services to reflect where residents from that CCG are visiting to receive their actual care. For example if Trust X provided 80% of attendances for a single CCG, 80% of this CCGs score would be comprised of the ratings from Trust X.¬CQC ratings¬"http://www.cqc.org.uk/content/how-get-and-re-use-cqc-information-and-data#directory

The indicator is a composite value, calculated as the average of six survey questions from the survey, and is based on responses for which the patients Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) of registration is available. Responses to the survey reflect women who gave birth during January or February of the reference year.  The six survey questions are:

1. During your antenatal check-ups, were you given enough time to ask questions or discuss your pregnancy? Answer options: yes always; yes sometimes; no; dont know.
2. Thinking about your antenatal care, were you involved enough in decisions about your care? Answer options: yes always; yes sometimes; no; dont know/cant remember.

CCGs also need to evidence implementation of the revised statutory guidance on Transforming Participation in Health and Care and the impact public involvement has had on the development of their business.¬This indicator is created via assessment of 10 key actions outlined in the revised Patient and public participation in commissioning health care: Statutory guidance for clinical commissioning groups and NHS England, which enable CCGs to demonstrate they meet their statutory duties.¬N/A¬"Assessors from the NHS England Public Participation Team collect publicly-available information from CCG websites that evidences how they comply with their statutory responsibilities and the following related ten key actions:

Ratings from the 5 domains are taken to give an overall score out of 15 and a RAG rating for the CCG.

The detailed scoring process is as follows. The assessor reviews the available evidence against each criterion in the good category. In order to achieve good the CCG needs to meet a minimum number of criteria for the domain, as follows:
Domain A = 3 criteria met of 4
Domain B = 4 criteria met of 5
Domain C = 5 criteria met of 7
Domain D = 3 criteria met of 3
Domain E = 4 criteria met of 5

If a CCG does not meet good for the domain it is rated either as requires improvement subject to meeting the necessary criteria, or as inadequate.
In order to achieve outstanding the CCG needs first to achieve the good rating for that domain, then to meet a minimum number of criteria in the outstanding category (in addition to having met good) as follows:
Domain A = 3 criteria met of 4
Domain B = 1 criteria met of 1
Domain C = 3 criteria met of 4
Domain D = 3 criteria met of 3
Domain E = 3 criteria met of 3

Ratings across each domain are scored as follows (0 = Inadequate, 1 = Requires Improvement, 2 = Good, 3 = Outstanding). These scores are totalled to reach a maximum score of 15. RAG ratings are determined using the following bandings 0-4 = RED, 5-9 = AMBER, 10-13= GREEN, 14-15 = GREEN STAR. If a CCG scores inadequate in any category it is not possible to achieve above an AMBER rating.

Review of insight will be undertaken by NHS Englands local teams, including a senior level conversation or meeting with relevant, director level members of the DCO and CCG teams. An evidence based judgement will be made against the indicator criteria.
A risk based schedule of reviews will be put in place at the start of each year, although insight received may prompt a review outside of the schedule.

Evidence would be drawn from, but not limited to, CCG IAF data and the CCG's own documents such as board papers, annual report and governance statement, reporting, monitoring and assurance systems, records of improvement actions undertaken, risk logs, clinical, internal and external audit reports, staff survey results, the organisational development (OD) plan, and staff turnover rates. STP/ACS footprint documents and NHS England STP/ACS assessments will also be relevant in assessing the CCG leaderships approach to its STP/ACS.

Much of the variation in emergency admission to secondary care is due to a range of factors in the provision of a primary care, and to patients understanding of their condition (and thus the ability to self-manage). Symptomatic asthma control is best assessed using directive questions such as the RCP three questions. Proactive structured review, as opposed to opportunistic or unscheduled review, is associated with reduced exacerbation rate and days lost from normal activity. The RCP three questions is an effective way of assessing a persons asthma control:
In the last month:
1. Have you had difficulty sleeping because of your asthma symptoms (including
cough)?
2. Have you had your usual asthma symptoms during the day (cough, wheeze, chest
tightness or breathlessness)?
3. Has your asthma interfered with your usual activities (for example housework, work or

This indicator measures the intermediate health outcome of a blood pressure of 150/90mmHg or less in patients with hypertension and coronary heart disease (CHD). Its intent is to promote the secondary prevention of CVD through satisfactory blood pressure control. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) clinical guideline on hypertension recommends a target blood pressure below 140/90 mmHg in patients aged 79 or under with treated hypertension and a clinic blood pressure below 150/90 mmHg in patients aged 80 or over, with treated hypertension.

In support of this, the RightCare CVD prevention programme is now rolling out to all CCGs with a specific focus on improving the detection and treatment of hypertension and atrial fibrillation (AF). CVD, including strokes and heart attacks, is highly preventable. Primary prevention through population and individual interventions is clearly of central importance, but secondary prevention through treatment of high-risk conditions, such as high blood pressure, AF and high cholesterol, can substantially improve outcomes in a relatively short timeframe. There is robust evidence that treatment in these conditions is effective at preventing strokes, heart attacks and other cardiovascular events. For example, anticoagulation in AF reduces stroke risk by two-thirds.¬Number of patients with atrial fibrillation, a CHA2DS2-VASc score of at least 2 and who are treated with anti-coagulation drug therapy.¬Number of patients on the quality outcomes framework (QOF) register with atrial fibrillation in whom there is a record of a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 2 or more.¬"The following fields are required from QOF:  Numerator field for the referenced indicator (as NUMERATOR); Denominator field for the referenced indicator (as DENOMINATOR)

Poor rates of early diagnosis are widely accepted to be the main reason the UK lags behind its peers when comparing cancer survival rates. Increasing the rate of early diagnosis has the potential to both improve health outcomes for patients and increase the cost effectiveness of NHS spend as spending on cancer treatment may be offset by cost savings elsewhere. Of the 290,000 cases of cancer diagnosed in the UK each year, most will come via symptomatic presentation to primary care. The two week waiting time national target for suspected cancer urgent referrals was introduced in 2000 and this indicator represents a conversion rate of urgent referrals within the two week time frame to cancer diagnoses. As calculations are based on smaller numbers than other indicators in this set, the chance of random variation is higher.

Operational standard is 80%"¬Cervical cancer is the 17th most common cause of cancer death among females in the UK (2014), accounting for 1% of all cancer deaths in females. This is one of the few cancers that is preventable because pre-cancerous cell changes can be picked up before they have a chance to develop into cancer. While no cervical screening test can be 100% effective, cervical screening programmes (CSPs) greatly reduce the incidence of this cancer in the screened population.

A list of conditions is provided in Annex D. The proportion of emergency admissions for ACS conditions is larger in under 5s and over 75s. Children are predominantly admitted for acute conditions, older people for chronic conditions and both groups for vaccine preventable conditions. The rate in most deprived areas is more than twice the rate in the least deprived areas in England. Emergency admissions for ambulatory care sensitive conditions cost the NHS approximately £1.42 billion annually. Influenza and pneumonia account for the largest proportion of admissions (13 per cent) and expenditure (£286 million). Many of these cases are vaccine preventable A higher emergency admission rate indicates there may be scope for improvement in management of patients with ACS conditions in the primary care setting.¬Total number of inpatient spells started during the last four complete Quarters for patients with an emergency method of admission (excluding via Mental Health Crisis Resolution Team) and with a diagnosis of one of the 19 identified ACS conditions (Annex D).

It is the most common reason for urgent admissions to hospital in children and young people in England. Unfortunately there are a number of avoidable deaths in children and young people from asthma every year. The UK has the third highest risk of death from childhood asthma in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) nations. In 2014, there were 24,744 emergency admissions for asthma, and 21 children under 14 years died from asthma in 2012. Preventable factors were identified in 90% of childhood deaths from Asthma. Asthma responds well to appropriate management and which is principally managed in primary care. Much of the variation in emergency admission to secondary care is due to a range of factors in the provision of a primary care, and to patients understanding of their condition (and thus the ability to self-manage).¬Total number of inpatient spells started during the last four complete Quarters for patients with an emergency method of admission (excluding via Mental Health Crisis Resolution Team) and with primary diagnosis code between J45 and J46¬Number of patients on the quality and outcome framework (QOF) register for Asthma¬"The following fields are required from HES:  Admidate, FAE, Epiend, Epistart, AdmiMeth (in 21,22,12,24,28, 2A, 2B, 2C, 2D), DIAG_3_01  (btn J45 & J46), GPPRAC (group by) (as NUMERATOR).

Failure to identify these less severe cases may lead to higher emergency cancer admission, and will impact on 1-year survival rates, as cancer will be further advanced when finally diagnosed. Often patients diagnosed through emergency presentation have cancers which are at an advanced stage, meaning these cancers are less amenable to curative treatment, and therefore have significantly poorer survival than those diagnosed through other routes (e.g. Lung cancer patients diagnosed through emergency presentation had a 1-year survival rate of 11.4%, compared to 28.6% for patients with all routes to diagnosis.¬Total number of inpatient spells started during the last four complete Quarters for patients with an emergency method of admission (excluding via Mental Health Crisis Resolution Team) and with the primary diagnosis codes between 'C00' and 'C97'¬Number of patients on the quality and outcome framework (QOF) register defined as a 'register of patients with a diagnosis of cancer excluding non-malacotic skin cancers diagnosed on or after April 2013 ¬"The following fields are required from HES:  Admidate, FAE, Epiend, Epistart, AdmiMeth (in 21,22,12,24,28, 2A, 2B, 2C, 2D), DIAG_3_01  (btn C00 & C97), GPPRAC (group by) (as NUMERATOR)

Clinicians in primary care have the skills to assess patients symptoms and the adequacy of their control, to monitor the progression of their disease, identify the development of complications and the need for referral to secondary care or other specialists. The majority of patients with COPD are managed by GPs and members of the primary healthcare team with onward referral to secondary care when required. Pulmonary rehabilitation should be offered to all patients who consider themselves to be functionally disabled by their COPD (MRC Dyspnoea Scale ?3 recorded). Failure to identify cases early in the progression of the disease will impact on sensitivity to treatment, increase secondary care requirements and reduce quality of life.¬Total number of inpatient spells started during the last four complete Quarters for patients with an emergency method of admission (excluding via Mental Health Crisis Resolution Team) and with the primary diagnosis between 'J40' and 'J44''¬Number of patients on the quality and outcome framework QOF register for COPD¬"The following fields are required from HES:  Admidate, FAE, Epiend, Epistart, AdmiMeth (in 21,22,12,24,28, 2A, 2B, 2C, 2D), DIAG_3_01  (btn J40 & J44), GPPRAC (group by) (as NUMERATOR)

482¬Emergency Dementia Admissions rate per 100 patients by GP practice¬Rate of emergency dementia admissions per 100 patients on the practice disease register for dementia by GP practice¬Emergency Dementia admissions per 100 patients on the practice disease register for Dementia¬Dementia is a progressive and mostly irreversible clinical syndrome, resulting in impairment of mental function. It is the leading cause of death in England, accounting for 11.6% of all recorded deaths and represents one of the most significant challenges facing health and social care services in England. Figures obtained by the Alzheimers Society and MHP Health Mandate have revealed a 12% rise in the number of emergency hospital admissions for people with dementia since 2006, costing the NHS an additional £2.8 million. Co-ordinated health and social care interventions can help prevent unwarranted admission to hospital. People living with dementia should have regular face-to-face reviews of their care plan with an aim to encourage the coordinated delivery of health and social care services. Regular reviews are important because the needs of a person with dementia and their carers may change over time. National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines state that a face-to-face review allows primary care practitioners to fully assess the changing needs of people with dementia and their carers and ensure that coordination between health and social services is achieved.¬Total number of inpatient spells started during the last four complete Quarters for patients with an emergency method of admission (excluding via Mental Health Crisis Resolution Team) and with the primary diagnosis between 'F00' and 'F03'¬Number of patients on the quality and outcome framework (QOF) register for Dementia¬"The following fields are required from HES:  Admidate, FAE, Epiend, Epistart, AdmiMeth (in 21,22,12,24,28, 2A, 2B, 2C, 2D), DIAG_3_01  (btn F00 & F03), GPPRAC (group by) (as NUMERATOR)

https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/quality-and-outcomes-framework-achievement-prevalence-and-exceptions-data/

Last accessed 18 February 2019"¬Exception reporting applies to indicators in any domain of the QOF, where the achievement is determined by the percentage of patients receiving the specified level of care. Exceptions are patients who are on the disease register and who would ordinarily be included in an indicator denominator. However they are excepted from the indicator denominator because they meet at least one of the exception criteria set out in the General Medical Services Statement of Financial Entitlements. Therefore, a practice with a high overall exception rate may be due to a variety of these criteria having been met. Exception reporting exists to help ensure practices are not financially penalised when the reason for non-achievement is beyond their control. Although patients may be excepted from the denominator, they should still be the recipients of best clinical care and practice. The duty of care remains for all patients, irrespective of exception reporting arrangements. Where this indicator is provided for quality improvement rather than service payment; therefore there should be no exception reporting and a high exception rate may act as a prompt to support further local conversations as to why this may be. Contractors may be called on to explain why they have excepted patients from an indicator and have a high exception rate.¬Sum of the Exceptions for all QOF indicators¬Sum of the Denominators for all QOF indicators plus the Sum of the Exceptions for all QOF indicators¬The following fields are required from QOF:  Total no. of exceptions across all indicators (as NUMERATOR);  Total denominators plus total exceptions for all indicators (as DENOMINATOR)¬QOF¬"https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/quality-and-outcomes-framework-achievement-prevalence-and-exceptions-data

There is no operational standard"¬The Government set a national ambition to eliminate inappropriate OAPs in mental health services for adults in acute inpatient care by 2020-21. Inappropriate OAPs are where patients are sent out of area because no bed is available for them locally, which can delay their recovery. It is essential to collect OAPs data in order to monitor progress towards achieving the ambition and to understand where and why OAPs are happening. Having this information is critical to improving patient care and ultimately eliminating the practice of inappropriately sending patients out of area to receive acute inpatient care.¬The number of bed days due to inappropriate out of area bed days for adult non specialist acute mental health care.¬N/A¬"An OAP is when a patient with assessed acute mental health needs who requires non-specialised inpatient care (CCG commissioned), is admitted to a unit that does not form part of the usual local network of services. This includes inpatient units that:
a) are not run by the patients home mental health care provider, regardless of distance travelled or whether the admitting unit is run by an NHS or Independent Sector Provider (ISP);
b) are not intended to admit people living in the catchment of the persons local community mental health team (CMHT);
c) are located in a place where the person cannot be visited regularly by their care coordinator to ensure continuity of care and effective discharge planning.

HES A&E data is used to estimate what proportion of activity from a provider can be attributed to each CCG. These proportions are applied to both numerator and denominator (provider based monthly collection figures on breaches and attendances) to assign numbers to each CCG. A limit of 1% is used, so any percentages of less than 1% for a mapping to a CCG are ignored in the calculations. Thus the numbers of attendances / breaches does not correspond to the actual figures and should only be used as a basis for estimating performance."¬NHS England: A&E attendances and emergency admissions monthly return.¬"https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/ae-waiting-times-and-activity/

Cancer waiting times performance is assessed using quarterly data.  Monthly data is also collected but this is provisional and is subject to change as records are validated within the quarter.  As a consequence the sum of the standalone published monthly data for a given quarter does not equal the equivalent standalone quarterly published data.  Data items represent the latest finalised quarterly performance data as well as the most recent monthly provisional data in order to show an indication of the progress within the quarter.  Operational standards only apply to quarterly data aggregated for all tumour categories.

Tumour types are breast, urological (excluding testicular), lower gastrointestinal (GI), skin, lung and all cancer.
