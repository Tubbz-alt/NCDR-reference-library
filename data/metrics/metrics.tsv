178	95% of A&E attendances from arrival to admission, transfer or discharge within 4 hours	A&E attendances to all Type 1, 2, 3 and 4 departments	A&E waiting times form part of the NHS Constitution. NHS England must take into account the expected rights and pledges for patients that are made in the constitution when assessing organisational delivery. This measure aims to encourage providers to improve health outcomes and patient experience of A&E. The four-hour access standard is an intuitive, pragmatic and simple process measure that holds acute trust boards to account to improve emergency care. It provides powerful incentives for NHS managers to improve patient care in emergency departments. Recently, it has become apparent that the standard is a useful indicator of how the whole urgent care system – from NHS 111 call, primary care contact, ambulance response, emergency admission and discharge to social care – performs.

266	Inequality in unplanned hospitalisation for chronic ambulatory care sensitive and urgent care sensitive conditions	This indicator reports the proportion of individuals with chronic ambulatory care sensitive conditions admitted to hospital as an emergency admission in the respective financial year.  A data period of 12 months is used to produce an annual output.  Data are shown for all persons, directly standardised by age and sex.  Directly age and sex standardised admission rate for unplanned hospitalisation for chronic ambulatory care sensitive conditions per 100,000 registered patients, 95% confidence intervals (CI).  The admissions rate for each LSOA-CCG is constructed using the CCG of registration and LSOA of residence.  The indirectly age and sex-standardised rate of unplanned hospitalisation per 100,000 registered population is calculated for every LSOA of residence, because these are legitimate drivers in the variation in avoidable emergency admissions. Indirect standardisation must be used as there are many LSOAs that do not have populations in all age-sex groups.  The Absolute Gradient of Inequality (AGI) is calculated for each CCG by weighted least squares using the indirectly age-standardised rate of unplanned hospitalisation per 100,000 registered population as the dependent variable; the rank of IMD 2015 (on a scale of 0 to 1) as the independent variable, and the CCG’s population in each LSOA as the weight. The coefficient on the rank of IMD is the slope and is called the AGI.  As the IMD is on a scale of 0 to 1, the slope gives the expected difference in the rate of unplanned hospitalisation in the most deprived compared to the least deprived LSOA in England if they were in that CCG.	Inequalities persist and these should be reduced for the benefit of patients and for CCGs to meet legal duties. The indicator will encourage such action.

267	Appropriate prescribing of antibiotics in primary care	For data at CCG level, prescriptions written by a prescriber located in a particular CCG but dispensed outside that CCG will be included in the CCG in which the prescriber is based. Prescriptions written in England but dispensed outside England are included. Prescriptions dispensed in hospitals, dental prescribing and private prescriptions are not included in the data. The data is to include prescribing by Out of Hours and Urgent Care services where relevant prescribing data is captured within NHS BSA ePACT2.  The numerator represents actual population figures and do not need to be standardised. When used in conjunction with STAR-PUs data is comparable across CCGs.  There are differences in the age and sex of patients for whom drugs in specific therapeutic groups are usually prescribed. STAR-PUs (Specific Therapeutic Group Age-sex weightings Related Prescribing Units) allow more accurate and meaningful comparisons within a specific therapeutic group by taking into account the types of people who will be receiving that treatment. This weighting is designed to weight individual practice or organisation populations for age and sex to allow for better comparison of prescribing patterns. The total number of Oral antibacterials (BNF 5.1 sub-set) ITEM based STAR-PUs are used as the denominator of this indicator.  STAR-PU weightings have been updated to reflect current prescribing practice, based on prescribing patterns in primary care in England in 2013. These were made available and introduced into national prescribing data sets in February 2014.	The purpose of this indicator is to encourage an improvement in appropriate antibiotic prescribing in primary care. Antimicrobial resistant infections impact on patient safety and the quality of patient care. Evidence suggests that antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is driven by over-using antibiotics and prescribing them inappropriately. Reducing the inappropriate use of antibiotics will delay the development of antimicrobial resistance that leads to patient harm from infections that are harder and more costly to treat. Reducing inappropriate antibiotic use will also protect patients from healthcare acquired infections such as Clostridium difficile infections.

269	Carers with a long term condition who feel supported to manage their condition	The proportion of carers with a long term condition who feel supported to manage their condition, measured based on responses to questions from the GP Patient Survey.  The GP Patient Survey includes a weight for non-response bias (wt_new). This adjusts the data to account for potential differences between the demographic profile of all eligible patients in a practice and the patients who actually complete the questionnaire. The non-response weighting scheme has been developed by Ipsos MORI, incorporating elements such as age and gender of the survey respondent as well as factors from the area where the respondent lives such as level of deprivation, ethnicity profile, ACORN classification and so on, which have been shown to impact on non-response bias within the GP Patient Survey.  The questionnaire records people’s views on whether they feel supported from local services or organisations in managing their conditions in question 32: “In the last 6 months, have you had enough support from local services or organisations to help you to manage your long-term health condition(s)? Please think about all services and organisations, not just health services.”	As set out in the Five Year Forward view: ‘The five and a half million carers in England make a critical and underappreciated contribution not only to loved ones, neighbours and friends, but to the very sustainability of the NHS itself. We will find new ways to support carers, building on the new rights created by the Care Act, and especially helping the most vulnerable amongst them – the approximately 225,000 young carers and the 110,000 carers who are themselves aged over 85. This will include working with voluntary organisations and GP practices to identify them and provide better support. For NHS staff, we will look to introduce flexible working arrangements for those with major unpaid caring responsibilities’. This metric will help understand the amount of support given to carers who have one or more long term conditions.	People who answer ‘Yes’ to Q60 are assumed a carer, regardless of how many hours of care they provide. Those who answer otherwise are not considered in the calculation. Gender and age of a respondent are derived from Q51 and Q52 of the survey. Further only people resident in an English region are included in the indicator.   Data are then filtered based on Q30 and Q31 to isolate those who report having one or more long-term condition (LTC). Respondents are identified as having a LTC if they answer ‘Yes’ to Q30 of the GP Patient Survey. Respondents are recoded to a ‘Yes’ in Q30 if they fail to acknowledge their LTC in Q30, but tick a condition in Q31.  Answers of ‘Yes, definitely’ and ‘Yes, to some extent’ are then recorded in response to Q32.	The weighted count of respondents who answer ‘Yes, definitely’ OR ‘Yes, to some extent’ OR ‘No’ to question 32 of the GP Patient Survey.	The weighted count of respondents who answer ‘Yes, definitely’ OR ‘Yes, to some extent’ OR ‘No’ to question 32 of the GP Patient Survey: Σk(wt_newkx1)  where k = 1, …, p are respondents with a long-term condition who answer ‘Yes, definitely’ OR ‘Yes, to some extent’ OR ‘No’.  Respondents who answer ‘Yes, to some extent’ are deemed to feel half as supported as respondents who answer ‘Yes, definitely’ to question 32. Therefore, this group of responses is weighted by 0.5 when calculating the numerator. Given the data filter above, the numerator is therefore calculated as: Σi (wt_newix1)+Σj (wt_newjx0.5) where i = 1, …, m are respondents with a long-term condition who answer ‘Yes, definitely’; and j = 1, …, n are respondents with a long-term condition who answer ‘Yes, to some extent’.

270	Hospital - provision of high quality care	A score from 0 – 100 for the sector-based indicator covering hospitals, comprised of aggregated scores which have been allocated to CQC inspection ratings on five key questions for each service asking “Is it safe ?”, “Is it effective ?”, “Is it well-led ?”, “is it caring ?”, “is it responsive ?”.  Hospital sector comprises Acute, Mental Health and Community and is based on the ratings awarded to the core services rated for each of CQC's five key questions. For Acute and Mental Health hospitals the ratings are sourced at provider level to maximise coverage across the CCG areas and to be consistent across both hospital areas.  The hospital sector's maximum score is based on the ratings awarded to the core services rated for each of CQC's five key questions, but is weighted to maximise coverage across the CCG areas and to be consistent across both Acute and Mental Health hospital areas.	This metric provides an overall score indicative of the quality of care in a CCG area as determined by CQC inspection ratings.

Weighted maximum score to reflect where CCG residents have attended for acute and mental health services	For hospitals, the key question ratings for each core service is converted to a number and added together across the locations that have been rated. The numerator for hospitals includes all rated services, which usually covers what CQC call ‘core services’. The hospitals metric uses patient datasets to weight the numerator for Acute and Mental Health Services to reflect where residents from that CCG are visiting to receive their actual care.

275	One-year survival for all cancers	A measure of the number of adults diagnosed with any type of cancer in a year who are still alive one year after diagnosis.  All adults (15–99 years) who were diagnosed with a first, primary, invasive malignancy are eligible for inclusion. Patients diagnosed with malignancy of the skin other than melanoma are excluded. Non-melanoma skin cancer is regularly excluded from cancer indicators as its impact on health is much less than other cancers and there are comparatively large numbers of cases which could significantly impact any statistic that includes it. Cancer of the prostate is also excluded from the index, because the widespread introduction of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing since the early 1990s has led to difficulty in the interpretation of survival trends.	To encourage work to improve cancer survival rates - a key component of the strategy to achieve world-class cancer outcomes.	Net survival is the probability of survival derived solely from the risk of death from cancer, compensating for the risk of death from other causes, i.e. background mortality. Background mortality is accounted for through life tables of all-cause mortality rates for the general population in England.  To obtain an unbiased estimation of net survival, age needs to be carefully modelled to account for the informative censoring associated with age. Flexible parametric models were used, with age and year of diagnosis as main effects and an interaction between age and year of diagnosis. The best-fitting statistical model was selected by assessing the relative goodness of fit using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), with scaling tests to check for oversensitivity and a likelihood ratio test to compare the best-fitting models according to AIC and BIC. A separate model was fitted for each CCG, type of cancer and sex.    See: Index of Cancer Survival Quality and Methodology Information in source address.	See numerator.	The following data fields in the Index of Cancer Survival for CCGs are used to construct the indicator: Geography; Years since diagnosis; Survival (%); Precision for each calendar year of diagnosis.  Fields are filtered by the number of patients aged 15 to 99 years diagnosed with any type of cancer in a year who are still alive one year after diagnosis. Cancer is defined as a first, primary, invasive malignancy with two exclusions; Non-melanoma skin cancer (ICD-10 C44) and cancer of the prostate (C61).

The methodology used to calculate one-year survival is the ‘classical’ or ‘cohort’ approach. All patients diagnosed in the diagnosis period are followed-up to one year later. Net survival is an estimate of the probability of survival from the cancer alone. It is defined as the ratio of the observed survival and the survival that would have been expected if the cancer patients had experienced the same background mortality by age and sex as the general population. It can be interpreted as the survival of cancer patients after taking into account the background mortality that the patients would have experienced if they had not had cancer.   Net survival varies with age, sex and type of cancer and all of these factors can vary with time and between geographical areas, so the estimates are age, sex and cancer standardised to facilitate comparison.  The survival index is constructed by using a weighted average of all the cancer survival estimates for each age, sex and cancer, using weights based on the International Classification of Survival Standard for age-standardisation, with additional weighting applied to standardise for sex and cancer type.	IAF	NHSE	OIC	Fiona Leat	To make figures from the past comparable with those from today and in the future, it is necessary to adjust an all-cancers survival index for changes over time in the profile of cancer patients by age, sex and type of cancer within each CCG.

287	Neonatal mortality and stillbirths	The number of stillbirths and neonatal deaths per 1,000 births.  A stillbirth is defined as a baby delivered at or after 24 weeks gestational age showing no signs of life, irrespective of when the death occurred. A neonatal death is defined as a live born baby born at 24 weeks gestational age or later, or with a birthweight of 400g or more who died before 28 completed days after birth.  The following are excluded from the data: Terminations of pregnancy (including late terminations after 24 weeks gestational age); stillbirths / neonatal deaths that occur as a result of a congenital anomaly and; births less than 24 weeks gestational age (and any neonatal deaths associated with these births).  Data is for births where the mother was resident in an English Lower Super Output Area (LSOA) only.	The indicator is the focus in the 2016/17 Mandate to NHS England to make measurable progress towards reducing the rate of stillbirths, neonatal and maternal deaths and brain injuries that are caused during or soon after birth by 50% by 2030; with a measurable reduction by 2020.

Women were eligible for the survey if they had a live birth within the sampling period, were aged 16 or older and gave birth in a hospital, birth centre or maternity unit, or had a home birth.  The indicator is a composite value, calculated as the average of six survey questions from the survey, and is based on responses for which the patient’s CCG of registration is available. Responses to the survey reflect women who gave birth during January or February of the reference year.  The six survey questions are:  1. During your antenatal check-ups, were you given enough time to ask questions or discuss your pregnancy? Answer options: yes always; yes sometimes; no; don’t know. 2. Thinking about your antenatal care, were you involved enough in decisions about your care? Answer options: yes always; yes sometimes; no; don’t know/can’t remember. 3. Were you (and/or your partner or a companion) left alone by midwives or doctors at a time when it worried you? Answer options: yes during early labour; yes during the later stages of labour; yes during the birth; yes shortly after the birth; no not at all. 4. If you raised a concern during labour and birth, did you feel that it was taken seriously? Answer options: yes; no; I did not raise any concerns. 5. Thinking about the care you received in hospital after the birth of your baby, were you treated with kindness and understanding? Answer options: yes always; yes sometimes; no; don’t know/can’t remember. 6. Did you feel that midwives and other carers gave you active support and encouragement about feeding your baby? Answer options: yes always; yes sometimes; no; I did not want/need this; don’t know/can’t remember.	Patient experience is one of the three domains of quality care, along with safety and clinical effectiveness. The purpose of this indicator is to encourage the improvement of patient experience in maternity services and support people to shape and manage their own health and care. To help service users make meaningful choices to achieve better health outcomes, progressing towards a person-centred NHS. This indicator strives to measure patient experience across the entirety of the maternity pathway, that is, antenatal, intrapartum and postnatal stages.

Score denominators are then calculated via assigning a value of 1 if question was answered by respondent, 0 if not. These are multiplied by the weighting allocated to respondents. The standardised mean score for each CCG per question is then calculated. This is achieved by dividing the sum of the weighted scores by the sum of the weighted number of eligible respondents for each question for each CCG. The composite indicator score per CCG is then calculated as the mean of the scores across the six questions multiplied by a factor of ten.  Individual scores are weighted for age and parity (the respondent’s age is derived from trust level sample files, which are not available to NHS England): Parity is derived from answers to question G3. Respondents are then grouped according to six age and parity categories. Calculating the CCG proportions for age and parity. Calculating respondent level proportions – divide national proportion of respondents in their age or parity group by corresponding CCG proportion.  A maximum weighting cap is assigned to limit excessive weight being given to respondents in an extremely under-represented group. No minimum weighting cap is calculated as assigning very small weights to over-represented groups does not have the same potential to give excessive impact to the responses of small numbers of individual respondents.

Women were eligible for the survey if they had a live birth within the sampling period, were aged 16 or older and gave birth in a hospital, birth centre or maternity unit, or had a home birth.  The indicator is a composite value, calculated as the average score of six survey questions from the CQC Maternity Survey. It uses survey results to specifically look at the choices offered to users of maternity services throughout the care pathway (antenatal, intrapartum and postnatal). Responses to the survey reflect women who gave birth during January or February of the reference year. The six survey questions are:  1. Were you offered any of the following choices about where to have your baby? Answer options: a choice of hospitals; a choice of giving birth in a midwife led unit or birth centre; a choice of giving birth in a consultant led unit; a choice of giving birth at home; not offered any choices; no choices due to medical reasons; don’t know/can't remember. 2. Did you get enough information from either a midwife or doctor to help you decide where to have your baby? Answer options: yes, definitely; yes, to some extent; no; no, but I did not need this information; don’t know/can’t remember. 3. Were you offered a choice of where your antenatal assessments would take place? Answer options: yes; no; don't know/can't remember. 4.

296	Deaths with 3 or more emergency admissions in the last 3 months of life	Repeat emergency admissions during end of life care.  There is no exclusion for type of death, other than to exclude neonatal deaths.	The purpose of the indicator is to encourage improvement in the quality of end of life care in the following ways: anticipatory planning and end of life care being addressed in a coordinated and timely way; key information about the person’s condition, needs and preferences being shared across the local health and care system, and; where unplanned needs arise (as they inevitably will for some people), in the speed and adequacy of urgent care response taking place where the person is, which should reduce the need for repeat emergency admissions during the last 90 days of life. The threshold of 3 or more is set to account for the fact that some unplanned needs may require emergency admission (e.g. an acute reversible event that may or may not be connected to the underlying condition, or an unexpected and sudden deterioration in symptom severity which requires urgent and close 24/7 medical and/or nursing management).

306	Probity and corporate governance	Evidences the implementation of the revised statutory guidance on managing conflicts of interest for CCGs and that conflicts of interest are being robustly and proactively managed by CCGs.	To evidence the implementation of the revised statutory guidance on managing conflicts of interest for CCGs and that conflicts of interest are being robustly and proactively managed by CCGs.	This indicator is a self-certification and assesses CCGs’ compliance with a number of requirements of the revised statutory guidance on managing conflicts of interest for CCGs. It is to be considered along with each CCG’s annual internal audit of conflicts of interest management, which will provide further assurance on the level of compliance with the statutory guidance.  The self-certification is signed by the CCG's Accountable Officer and Audit Chair.	N/A	This indicator consists of two parts:  Part one: An annual self-certification that requests confirmation that: The CCG has a clear policy for the management of conflicts of interest (in line with the statutory guidance on managing conflicts of interest for CCGs) and that the policy includes a robust process for the management of breaches. The CCG has a minimum of three lay members. This includes confirmation of the number of CCG lay members and how many days they are employed per month. The CCG’s audit chair has taken on the role of the conflicts of interest guardian, supported by a senior CCG manager(s). From 2018/19, 100% of relevant CCG staff have been offered the mandatory training on managing conflicts of interest and 90% of relevant CCG staff have completed it by 31st May. The training is mandatory for: CCG Governing Body Members Executive members of formal CCG committees and sub-committees Primary Care Commissioning Committee members Clinicians involved in commissioning or procurement decisions CCG governance leads Anyone involved or likely to be involved in taking a procurement decision(s)  Part two: A quarterly self-certification that requests confirmation that: The CCG has processes in place to ensure individuals declare any conflict or potential conflict of interest as soon as they become aware of it, and within 28 days, ensuring accurate, up-to-date registers are complete for: Conflicts of interest; Procurement decisions; and Gifts and hospitality.

Engagement index by provider, financial flows matrix is simply a matrix detailing spend by CCG to each trust.	To signal the expectation that CCGs demonstrate leadership across the organisations in their part of the NHS. One part of this leadership role will be in encouraging the growth of organisational cultures in which the workforce is highly engaged.

308	Progress against the Workforce Race Equality Standard	The single staff survey indicator KF 27 (percentage believing that trust provides equal opportunities for career progression or promotion) is believed to show the strongest, most consistent evidence of discriminatory treatment of BME staff when compared to white staff. The CCG indicator aims to represent where the ‘patch’ of each CCG compares in terms of the Workforce Race Equality Standard.  Responses are restricted by ethnicity into BME and White groups.  Financial flows matrix is simply a matrix detailing spend by CCG to each trust.  Independent healthcare providers do not undertake the NHS Staff Survey and will present data based upon an equivalent to the KF27 question as used within their own respective staff survey.	To signal the expectation that CCGs demonstrate leadership across the organisations in their part of the NHS. One part of this leadership role will be to demonstrate a commitment to equality including race equality. CCGs will need to demonstrate their use of the Workforce Race Equality Standard within their own organisations and to expect NHS providers in their footprint to do the same. The composite indicator of workforce race equality will show the extent of progress towards race equality across the patch, and will inform discussions between CCGs and their providers around how further progress can be made in race equality and more widely across all indicators of the Workforce Race Equality Standard and other dimensions of equality.	For each provider the WRES score is calculated by the sum of the difference between the BME and White WRES key findings (see calculation of metric).	N/A	N/A	NHS Staff Survey, KF 27.

309	Effectiveness of working relationships in the local system	This indicator shows the current status of the CCG's local system working relationships and also gives an assessment from the other key stakeholders of the CCG's effectiveness as a leader in its health and care system.  Missing data – “Don’t Know” or “I/we do not have a relationship with CCG” - would be taken as an indication of a poor working relationship and coded at the low end of the scales, equivalent to “fairly poor” and “very poor” respectively.  The level of responses is considered as contextual information.	To identify relationships that need to be strengthened and areas within the system where support may be necessary.	A score is created for each respondent which can vary between 0 and 100, with 100 the best possible score (see calculation of metric).	N/A	Responses are taken from two questions asked of all stakeholders: 1. Overall, how would you rate the effectiveness of your working relationship with [CCG NAME]?  Response options: Very good; Fairly good; Neither good nor poor; Fairly poor; Very poor; I/we do not have a working relationship with [CCG NAME]; Don’t know. 2. How effective, if at all, do you feel [CCG NAME] is as a local system leader?  Response options: Very effective; Fairly effective; Not very effective; Not at all effective; Don’t know.

310	Compliance with statutory guidance on patient and public participation in commissioning health and care	This indicator aims to evidence CCGs’ implementation of the revised statutory guidance on patient and public participation in commissioning health care and their compliance in fulfilling statutory duties (see technical specification).	Under the National Health Service Act 2006 (as amended by the Health and Social Care Act 2012, section 14Z2), CCGs need to demonstrate public and patient participation in commissioning health care.  CCGs also need to evidence implementation of the revised statutory guidance on Transforming Participation in Health and Care and the impact public involvement has had on the development of their business.	This indicator is created via assessment of 10 ‘key actions’ outlined in the revised ‘Patient and public participation in commissioning health care: Statutory guidance for clinical commissioning groups and NHS England’, which enable CCGs to demonstrate they meet their statutory duties.	N/A	Assessors from the NHS England Public Participation Team collect publicly-available information from CCG websites that evidences how they comply with their statutory responsibilities and the following related ‘ten key actions’: 1. Involve the public in governance 2. Explain public involvement in commissioning plans 3. Demonstrate public involvement in Annual Reports 4. Promote and publicise public involvement 5. Assess, plan and take action to involve 6. Feedback and Evaluate 7. Implement assurance and improvement systems 8. Advance equality and reduce health inequality 9. Provide support for effective engagement 10. Hold providers to account  The assessor reviews the CCG’s 2016/17 annual report, Constitution, involvement web pages, engagement strategy and action plan, governing body minutes, equality and diversity strategy, and other relevant information publicly available on the internet. The assessment takes 2-7 hours depending on the accessibility of the information.  The collected information is reviewed against the assessment framework, consisting of 49 criteria, agreed by the Public Participation Working Group and linked to the statutory duties and ‘key actions’. Criteria are grouped under the following 5 domains:  Domain A: Governance 1: Involve the public in governance 7: Implement assurance and improvement systems 10: Hold providers to account  Domain B: Annual Reporting 3. Demonstrate public involvement in Annual Reports  Domain C: Practice 2: Explain public involvement in commissioning plans 4: Promote and publicise public involvement 5: Assess, plan and take action to involve 9: Provide support for effective engagement  Domain D: Feedback and Evaluation 6: Feedback and Evaluate  Domain E: Equalities and Health Inequalities 8: Advance equality and reduce health inequality	N/A	N/A	CCG	Annually	Annually	Net	N/A	N/A	CCG	Annually	Annually	Net	Not in publication	The scoring process for each domain assesses the CCG as meeting or not meeting individual criteria, and then as: ‘Inadequate’, ‘Requires Improvement’, ‘Good’ or ‘Outstanding’ for each domain. Ratings from the 5 ‘domains’ are taken to give an overall score out of 15 and a RAG rating for the CCG.  The detailed scoring process is as follows. The assessor reviews the available evidence against each criterion in the ‘good’ category. In order to achieve ‘good’ the CCG needs to meet a minimum number of criteria for the domain, as follows: Domain A = 3 criteria met of 4 Domain B = 4 criteria met of 5 Domain C = 5 criteria met of 7 Domain D = 3 criteria met of 3 Domain E = 4 criteria met of 5  If a CCG does not meet ‘good’ for the domain it is rated either as ‘requires improvement’ subject to meeting the necessary criteria, or as ‘inadequate’. In order to achieve ‘outstanding’ the CCG needs first to achieve the ‘good’ rating for that domain, then to meet a minimum number of criteria in the ‘outstanding’ category (in addition to having met good) as follows: Domain A = 3 criteria met of 4 Domain B = 1 criteria met of 1 Domain C = 3 criteria met of 4 Domain D = 3 criteria met of 3 Domain E = 3 criteria met of 3  Ratings across each domain are scored as follows (0 = Inadequate, 1 = Requires Improvement, 2 = Good, 3 = Outstanding). These scores are totalled to reach a maximum score of 15. RAG ratings are determined using the following bandings 0-4 = RED, 5-9 = AMBER, 10-13= GREEN, 14-15 = GREEN STAR. If a CCG scores ‘inadequate’ in any category it is not possible to achieve above an AMBER rating. If a CCG achieves two or more ‘requires improvement’ it is not possible to achieve more than an AMBER rating.	IAF	NHSE	OIC	Fiona Leat		Ratified	0
311	Quality of CCG leadership	This indicator aims to assess a number of key leadership areas to determine how robustly the senior leaders of a CCG, both clinicians and managers, are performing their leadership role.  Review of insight will be undertaken by NHS England’s local teams, including a senior level conversation or meeting with relevant, director level members of the DCO and CCG teams. An evidence based judgement will be made against the indicator criteria. A risk based schedule of reviews will be put in place at the start of each year, although insight received may prompt a review outside of the schedule.  Evidence would be drawn from, but not limited to, CCG IAF data and the CCG's own documents such as board papers, annual report and governance statement, reporting, monitoring and assurance systems, records of improvement actions undertaken, risk logs, clinical, internal and external audit reports, staff survey results, the organisational development (OD) plan, and staff turnover rates. STP/ACS footprint documents and NHS England STP/ACS assessments will also be relevant in assessing the CCG leadership’s approach to its STP/ACS. For this indicator it would be usual to seek the relevant STP/ACS lead’s view of the contribution of the CCG to the STP/ACS. This is in addition to feedback provided as part of the CCG annual 360 stakeholder survey.  The frequency of KLOE reviews will be locally agreed based on the level of risk the CCG is carrying or issues that may emerge during the year. A review may only be required annually, unless there is leadership change.	There is a well-established process in place for reviewing sources of insight and reaching a consistent, evidence-based judgement in this area. A medium term aim would be for all CCGs to reach and maintain a green rating.	This indicator is created on the basis of evidence provided by the CCG, where 4 key lines of enquiry (KLOE) are reviewed (see technical specification). The KLOEs are reflective of the ‘well-led’ theme within the NHS Improvement single oversight framework for providers.	N/A	The 4 KLOEs are: 1. Leadership capability and capacity 2. Quality 3. Governance 4. Leadership around transformation	N/A	N/A	CCG	Quarterly	Quarter in lieu	Net	N/A	N/A	CCG	Quarterly	Quarter in lieu	Net	In publication	As the CCG’s risk level and local context will be taken in to account, not all sources of evidence would necessarily be considered for all CCGs at each review. A green star/green/amber/red rating would be used:  A GREEN rating would be given when the CCG has no issues or minor/low risk issues. Within this banding, a CCG that is considered very good, with practice that could be replicated as an exemplar, would be awarded a GREEN STAR rating. An AMBER rating would be given when moderate weaknesses have been identified. A RED rating would be given when there is significant failure to meet requirements.	IAF	NHSE	OIC	Fiona Leat		Ratified	26

470	No urgent operation should be cancelled for a second time	Include all urgent operations that are cancelled, including emergency patients (i.e. non-elective), who have their operations cancelled. In principle the majority of urgent cancellations will be urgent elective patients but it is possible that an emergency patient has their operation cancelled (eg patient presents at A&E with complex fracture which needs operating on. Patient's operation is arranged and subsequently cancelled).  The definition of 'urgent operation’ is one that should be agreed locally in the light of clinical and patient need. However, it is recommended that the guidance as suggested by the National Confidential Enquiry into Perioperative Deaths (NCEPOD) should be followed. Broadly these are: Immediate - Immediate (A) lifesaving or (B) limb or organ saving intervention. Operation target time within minutes of decision to operate. Urgent - Acute onset or deterioration of conditions that threaten life, limb or organ survival. Operation target time within hours of decision to operate. Expedited - Stable patient requiring early intervention for a condition that is not an immediate threat to life, limb or organ survival. Operation target time within days of decision to operate. Elective - Surgical procedure planned or booked in advance of routine admission to hospital.  Broadly, Immediate, Urgent and Expedited should be regarded as 'urgent' for the purpose of meeting this requirement.  An operation which is rescheduled to a time within 24 hours of the original scheduled operation should be recorded as a postponement and not as a cancellation. For postponements, the following apply: the 24 hour period is strictly 24 hours and not 24 working hours, i.e. it includes weekend/other non-working days; the patient should not be discharged from hospital during the 24 hour period; a patient cannot be postponed more than once (if they are then they count as a cancellation).

Clock start - arrival to Patient Handover performance (acute trusts): when an ambulance wheels stop in the patient offloading bay (handbrake applied and ‘Red at Hospital’ button is pressed on the MDT).  Clock stop - Patient Handover/Trolley Clear performance (acute trusts): the time at which clinical handover has been fully completed and the patient has been physically transferred onto hospital apparatus. Ambulance apparatus must have been returned enabling the ambulance crew to leave the department.  Count all accident, emergency and urgent patients if destined for A&E (either Type 1, 2 or 3). This includes GP urgent patients brought by ambulance to A&E. Do not count non-emergency patients. Patients being transported between locations/trusts/hospitals (eg for outpatient clinics, tertiary care) should not be counted. Ambulance trusts should not count the time required for crews to complete record forms, clean vehicles, re-stock vehicles or have a break.  Operational standard is 0.	Delaying ambulances outside A&E as a result of a temporary mismatch between A&E / hospital capacity and numbers of elective / emergency patients arriving is not acceptable. Implementation of the full hospital escalation plan should ensure that A&Es have significant capacity to avoid most instances of ambulance queuing.
