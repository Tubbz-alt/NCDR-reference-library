The NCDR is\r\nthe pseudonymised patient-level data repository managed by NHS England to deliver consistent data\r\nprocessing, linkage and reporting services, mainly for NHS England analytical teams, to aid in the\r\ndelivery of the Five Year Forward View.\r\nAll content is governed by internal review processes with further assurance received from subject\r\nmatter experts throughout the wider NHS and other healthcare organisations. We make sure that\r\neach definition is signed off by an expert in the area before publication to ensure this resource can\r\nbe trusted by all.\r\nIf you would like any further information, want to be involved with developing further content or\r\nwish to provide us with feedback, please contact us.\r\n\r\n### About us\r\nThe Reference Library Portal is owned and managed by the Data Service for Commissioners (DSfC)\r\nteam. The vision of the DSfC team is to enable commissioners to consistently access the data they\r\nneed in a lawful, consistent and efficient manner.\r\n\r\nThe work of Data Services for Commissioners will have broad reaching benefits for all analytical\r\nfunctions across NHS England and the wider commissioning landscape. The NCDR employs\r\nconsistent data quality processes and, where sufficient legal basis exists, enables access to and\r\nlinkage of pseudonymised patient-level data. This upholds the requirements of patient\r\nconfidentiality, as determined by the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO), while enabling the\r\nuse of sufficiently granular data to support commissioning and population health management.\r\nData Services for Commissioners is focussed on increasing information and digital capability to\r\nprovide the data that commissioners require for effective decision making, improving service quality,\r\nensuring safety, encouraging informatics colleagues to add value (rather than work on routine tasks)\r\nand promoting effectiveness and efficiency. These improvements will save time and resource for\r\ncolleagues within the wider NHS, allowing them to focus their expertise on improving outcomes for\r\npatients.\r\n\r\nThe NCDR also plays a key role in delivering Five Year Forward View objectives. By developing\r\ndatasets that are based on standard, consistent definitions across differing healthcare settings, NHS\r\nEngland will be better equipped to consistently track cohorts of people through their journey around\r\nthe NHS; an essential factor in moving towards preventative and early intervention care, and\r\npopulation health management.\r\n\r\nDSfC is committed to improving access to services by developing reusable routine reporting and\r\nanalysis methods, which can be adopted throughout the whole commissioning system to support\r\nstrategic programmes of work. By reducing the amount of time analysts spend processing data, time\r\ncan be spent more appropriately, increasing analytical capacity and access to reporting tools which\r\nwill provide improved business intelligence services to local, regional and national users.\r\nThrough developing one, central, data repository to store and transform linked datasets, the NCDR\r\nprovides a single source of the truth for data which can be accessed and analysed by colleagues\r\nacross the country, boosting connectivity and collaboration.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in finding out more about Data Service for Commissioners, please see our\r\nwebsite or contact us.\r\n\r\n### Site Map\r\n\r\n#### NCDR Data Definition\r\nThis section contains definitions of data items in specific databases and tables within the NCDR. It\r\nallows the user to find detailed information relating to all data items within the NCDR. The chosen\r\ndatabase and table names correspond directly with the setup within the databases.\r\nWith this knowledge, analysts can be assured that the data items they use in their analyses are\r\ncorrect, both in how they are derived by the NCDR team and used by analysts. By increasing the\r\nunderstanding of the data, the quality, scope and efficiency of analyses will be enhanced across the\r\ncountry.\r\n#### Reference Data\r\nIn development; if you are interested in working with us in developing the content for this section,\r\nplease contact us.\r\n\r\nThe Reference Data section will provide details on all data items within the NCDR, irrespective of\r\nwhich table these data items are stored in. It will also contain any codes and values that may form\r\npart of the reference data item.\r\n#### Mapping\r\nIn development; if you are interested in working with us in developing the content for this section,\r\nplease contact us.\r\n\r\nThe mapping section will enable the mapping of data items with the same meaning and use, but\r\nperhaps different names, along with the codes within them, if applicable. As an example, if there is\r\na field named \u2018Sex\u2019 in one dataset, and a field named \u2018Gender\u2019 in another, they could be mapped to\r\neach other, and if within the \u2018Sex\u2019 field, the code of \u20181\u2019 means male, and within the \u2018Gender\u2019 field \u2018M\u2019\r\nmeans male, the \u20181\u2019 and \u2018M\u2019 could also be mapped. When this is complete analyses across similar\r\nfields in different datasets will be streamlined, further improving our view of the patients\u2019 journey.\r\n\r\n#### Group\r\nIn development; if you are interested in working with us in developing the content for this section,\r\nplease contact us.\r\n\r\nThe group section will provide details of any groups that have been set up to help the user\r\ncommunity enhance their analytical capability. For example, a group could be set up that provides\r\ndetailed information to enable identification of patients with long term conditions, or groups that\r\nare disease specific, for example, cancer patients. Groups will be set up according to user needs and\r\npriorities. Please contact us if you have specific requirements that you wish to discuss."}}]
